# 9th Special Forces Group
The 9th Special Forces Group is an Arma 3 community whose play style is casual and whose member base is greatly restricted, so as to reduce the need for structure and increase the casual atmosphere of the community.

# This Project Specifically
This project is specifically an attempt to create a theme custom to the 9th SF. It is built for use on the "Bluethrust Clan Scripts V4" forums manager.

# Systems - Website
The 9th SFG website consists of two unique systems which act in harmony with each other.
1. The first is the WordPress powered website used as the CMS for all news, members, about and general public facing roles.
2. The second is the phpBB powered forum used for community management and private community matters.

## Integration & Harmony
To ensure no mismatch/conflicts arise between the two systems, a plugin named "WordPress w3all phpBB integration" by axew3 has been integrated into the WordPress system. This plugin handles syncronisation of user accounts between phpBB and WordPress, regardless on which system these user accounts were first created.
