# 9th Special Forces Group
The 9th Special Forces Group is an Arma 3 community whose play style is casual and whose member base is greatly restricted, so as to reduce the need for structure and increase the casual atmosphere of the community.

## This Project Specifically
This project is specifically an attempt to create a theme custom to the 9th SF. It is built for use on the "Bluethrust Clan Scripts V4" forums manager.
